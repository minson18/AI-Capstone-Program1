"At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR",1
He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried,1
"Dudley¡¦s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry¡¦s heart gave a leap",1
"Every year on Dudley¡¦s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away",1
Harry hated it there,1
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she¡¦d ever owned,1
"Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn¡¦t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys¡¦ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life",1
"His aunt and uncle hadn¡¦t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they¡¦d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside",1
"But today, nothing was going to go wrong",1
"It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn¡¦t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg¡¦s cabbage-smelling living room",1
But he wished he hadn¡¦t said anything,1
"If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn¡¦t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon ¡X they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. ked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn¡¦t blond",1
Harry had the best morning he¡¦d had in a long time,1
"He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn¡¦t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him",1
"They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn¡¦t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first",1
"Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last",1
After lunch they went to the reptile house,1
"It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone",1
"Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place",1
It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon¡¦s car and crushed it into a trash can ¡X but at the moment it didn¡¦t look in the mood,1
"In fact, it was fast asleep",1
"It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have",1

"It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have",1
"Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic",1
Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside,1
"Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint",1
"The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went",1
The Quidditch season had begun,1
"On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin",1
"If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship",1
"Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret",1
"But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn¡¦t know which was worse ¡X people telling him he¡¦d be brilliant or people telling him they¡¦d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend",1
"He didn¡¦t know how he¡¦d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do",1
"She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read",1
"Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert",1
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again,1
"With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night",1
"They tried retracing Harry¡¦s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily",1
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family,1
Nothing at all,1
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore,1
"Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn¡¦t noticed him",1
"Male eyes lingered on her as she picked her way through the road-works at the top of Oxford Street, consulting a piece of paper in her right hand",1
"Robin was, by any standards, a pretty girl; tall and curvaceous, with long strawberry-blonde hair that rippled as she strode briskly along, the chill air adding color to her pale cheeks. This was the first day of a week-long secretarial assignment",1
"She had been temping ever since coming to live with Matthew in London, though not for much longer; she had what she termed ¡§proper¡¨ interviews lined up now",1
"The most challenging part of these uninspiring piecemeal jobs was often finding the offices. London, after the small town in Yorkshire she had left, felt vast, complex and impenetrable",1
"Matthew had told her not to walk around with her nose in an A¡VZ, which would make her look like a tourist and render her vulnerable; she therefore relied, as often as not, on poorly hand-drawn maps that somebody at the temping agency had made for her. She was not convinced that this made her look more like a native-born Londoner. The metal barricades and the blue plastic Corimec walls surrounding the roadworks made it much harder to see where she ought to be going, because they obscured half the landmarks drawn on the paper in her hand",1
"She crossed the torn-up road in front of a towering office block, labeled ¡§Center Point¡¨ on her map, which resembled a gigantic concrete waffle with its dense grid of uniform square windows, and made her way in the rough direction of Denmark Street",1
"There had been no further calls or texts; she was maintaining the pretense that their last, filthy, volcanic row had changed her irrevocably, stripped away her love and purged her of fury",1
"Strike, however, knew Charlotte as intimately as a germ that had lingered in his blood for fifteen years; knew that her only response to pain was to wound the offender as deeply as possible, no matter what the cost to herself",1
"What would happen if he refused her an audience, and kept refusing",1
"It was the only strategy he had never tried, and all he had left",1
"Every now and then, when Strike¡¦s resistance was low (late at night, alone on his camp bed) the infection would erupt again: regret and longing would spike, and he saw her at close quarters, beautiful, naked, breathing words of love; or weeping quietly, telling him that she knew she was rotten, ruined, impossible, but that he was the best and truest thing she had ever known",1
"Then, the fact that he was a few pressed buttons away from speaking to her seemed too fragile a barricade against temptation, and he sometimes pulled himself back out of his sleeping bag and hopped in the darkness to Robin¡¦s abandoned desk, switching on the lamp and poring, even for hours, over the case report",1
"Once or twice he placed early-morning calls to Rochelle Onifade¡¦s mobile, but she never answered",1
"On Thursday morning, Strike returned to the wall outside St",1
"Thomas¡¦s, and waited for three hours in the hope of seeing Rochelle again, but she did not turn up",1
"He had Robin call the hospital, but this time they refused to comment on Rochelle¡¦s non-attendance, and resisted all attempts at getting an address for her. On Friday morning, Strike returned from an outing to Starbucks to find Spanner sitting not on the sofa beside Robin¡¦s desk, but on the desk itself",1
"He had an unlit roll-up in his mouth, and was leaning over her, apparently being more amusing than Strike had ever found him, because Robin was laughing in the slightly grudging manner of a woman who is entertained, but who wishes, nevertheless, to make it clear that the goal is well defended",1
"The light, bright sitting room had three tall windows, each of them with a shallow stone balcony beyond; its walls were Wedgwood blue and nearly everything else was white",1
"All was pristine, elegant and beautifully proportioned",1
"Here, too, there was a single superb painting: macabre, surreal, with a spearbearing man masked as a blackbird, arm in arm with a gray-toned headless female torso",1
It was from this room that Tansy Bestigui maintained she had heard a screaming match two floors above,1
"Strike moved up close to the long windows, noting the modern catches, the thickness of the panes, the complete lack of noise from the street, though his ear was barely half an inch from the cold glass. The balcony beyond was narrow, and filled with potted shrubs trimmed into pointed cones. Strike moved off towards the bedroom",1
"Robin remained in the sitting room, turning slowly where she stood, taking in the chandelier of Venetian glass, the muted rug in shades of pale blue and pink, the enormous plasma TV, the modern glass and iron dining table and silk-cushioned iron chairs; the small silver objets d¡¦art on glass side tables and on the white marble mantelpiece",1
"She thought, a little sadly, of the IKEA sofa of which she had, until now, felt so proud; then she remembered Strike¡¦s camp bed in the office with a twinge of shame",1
"Robin, following in the two men¡¦s wake, noticed a subtle change in the way that Strike was talking to the security man",1
"He was asking simple, deft questions, focusing on what Wilson had felt, touched, seen and heard at each step of his way through the flat",1
"Under Strike¡¦s guidance, Wilson¡¦s body language started to change",1
"He began to enact the way he had held the doorjambs, leaning into rooms, casting a rapid look around",1
"When he crossed to the only bedroom, he did it at a slow-motion run, responding to the spotlight of Strike¡¦s undivided attention; he dropped to his knees to demonstrate how he had looked under the bed, and at Strike¡¦s prompting remembered that a dress had lain crumpled beneath his legs; he led them, face set with concentration, to the bathroom, and showed them how he had swiveled to check behind the door before sprinting (he almost mimed it, arms moving exaggeratedly as he walked) back to the front door. The country was lumbering towards election day",1
"Strike turned in early on Sunday and watched the day¡¦s gaffes, counterclaims and promises being tabulated on his portable TV",1
There was an air of joylessness in every news report he watched,1
The national debt was so huge that it was difficult to comprehend,1
"Cuts were coming, whoever won; deep, painful cuts; and sometimes, with their weasel words, the party leaders reminded Strike of the surgeons who had told him cautiously that he might experience a degree of discomfort; they who would never personally feel the pain that was about to be inflicted",1
"On Monday morning Strike set out for a rendezvous in Canning Town, where he was to meet Marlene Higson, Lula Landry¡¦s biological mother. The arrangement of this interview had been fraught with difficulty",1
"Bristow¡¦s secretary, Alison, had telephoned Robin with Marlene Higson¡¦s number, and Strike had called her personally",1
"Though clearly disappointed that the stranger on the phone was not a journalist, she had initially expressed herself willing to meet Strike",1
"She had then called the office back, twice: firstly to ask Robin whether the detective would pay her expenses to travel into the center of town, to which a negative answer was given; next, in high dudgeon, to cancel the meeting",1
A second call from Strike had secured a tentative agreement to meet in her local pub; then an irritable voicemail message cancelled once more,1
"Strike had then telephoned her for a third time, and told her that he believed his investigation to be in its final phase, after which evidence would be laid to the police, resulting, he had no doubt, in a further explosion of publicity",1
"Now that he came to think about it, he said, if she was unable to help, it might be just as well for her to be protected from another deluge of press inquiry",1
"Marlene Higson had immediately clamored for her right to tell everything she knew, and Strike condescended to meet her, as she had already suggested, in the beer garden of the Ordnance Arms on Monday morning",1
He didn¡¦t understand how this could be possible,0
"His mind functioned without flaw, trying to calculate his surroundings and predicament",0
"Knowledge flooded his thoughts, facts and images, memories and details of the world and how it works. He pictured snow on trees, running down a leaf-strewn road, eating a hamburger, the moon casting a pale glow on a grassy meadow, swimming in a lake, a busy city square with hundreds of people bustling about their business. And yet he didn¡¦t know where he came from, or how he¡¦d gotten inside the dark lift, or who his parents were",0
He didn¡¦t even know his last name,0
"Images of people flashed across his mind, but there was no recognition, their faces replaced with haunted smears of color. He couldn¡¦t think of one person he knew, or recall a single conversation",0
"The room continued its ascent, swaying; Thomas grew immune to the ceaseless rattling of the chains that pulled him upward",0
A long time passed,0
"Minutes stretched into hours, although it was impossible to know for sure because every second seemed an eternity",0
No,0
He was smarter than that,0
"Trusting his instincts, he knew he¡¦d been moving for roughly half an hour. Strangely enough, he felt his fear whisked away like a swarm of gnats caught in the wind, replaced by an intense curiosity",0
He wanted to know where he was and what was happening,0
"With a groan and then a clonk, the rising room halted; the sudden change jolted Thomas from his huddled position and threw him across the hard floor. As he scrambled to his feet, he felt the room sway less and less until it finally stilled",0
Everything fell silent,0
A minute passed,0
"He looked in every direction but saw only darkness; he felt along the walls again, searching for a way out",0
"But there was nothing, only the cool metal",0
"He groaned in frustration; his echo amplified through the air, like the haunted moan of death",0
"It faded, and silence returned",0
"He screamed, called for help, pounded on the walls with his fists. The floor of the courtyard looked like it was made of huge stone blocks, many of them cracked and filled with long grasses and weeds. An odd, dilapidated wooden building near one of the corners of the square contrasted greatly with the gray stone",0
"A few trees surrounded it, their roots like gnarled hands digging into the rock floor for food",0
"Another corner of the compound held gardens¡Xfrom where he was standing Thomas recognized corn, tomato plants, fruit trees. Across the courtyard from there stood wooden pens holding sheep and pigs and cows. A large grove of trees filled the final corner; the closest ones looked crippled and close to dying",0
"The sky overhead was cloudless and blue, but Thomas could see no sign of the sun despite the brightness of the day",0
The creeping shadows of the walls didn¡¦t reveal the time or direction¡Xit could be early morning or late afternoon,0
"As he breathed in deeply, trying to settle his nerves, a mixture of smells bombarded him",0
"Freshly turned dirt, manure, pine, something rotten and something sweet",0
Somehow he knew that these were the smells of a farm,0
"Thomas looked back at his captors, feeling awkward but desperate to ask questions. Captors, he thought",0
"Then, Why did that word pop into my head",0
"He scanned their faces, taking in each expression, judging them",0
"One boy¡¦s eyes, flared with hatred, stopped him cold",0
"He looked so angry, Thomas wouldn¡¦t have been surprised if the kid came at him with a knife",0
"He had black hair, and when they made eye contact, the boy shook his head and turned away, walking toward a greasy iron pole with a wooden bench next to it",0
"A multicolored flag hung limply at the top of the pole, no wind to reveal its pattern",0
More broth ran from the corner of Bannen¡¦s mouth,0
Sam dabbed it away with a corner of his sleeve,0
The ranger¡¦s eyes were open but unseeing,0
"¡§I¡¦m cold,¡¨ he said again, so faintly",0
"A maester might have known how to save him, but they had no maester. Kedge Whiteye had taken Bannen¡¦s mangled foot o nine days past, in a gout of pus and blood that made Sam sick, but it was too little, too late",0
"¡§I¡¦m so cold,¡¨ the pale lips repeated",0
"About the hall, a ragged score of black brothers squatted on the oor or sat on rough-hewn benches, drinking cups of the same thin onion broth and gnawing on chunks of hardbread",0
"A couple were wounded worse than Bannen, to look at them",0
"Fornio had been delirious for days, and Ser Byam¡¦s shoulder was oozing a foul yellow pus. When they¡¦d left Castle Black, Brown Bernarr had been carrying bags of Myrish re, mustard salve, ground garlic, tansy, poppy, kingscopper, and other healing herbs. Even sweetsleep, which gave the gift of painless death",0
"But Brown Bernarr had died on the Fist and no one had thought to search for Maester Aemon¡¦s medicines. Hake had known some herblore as well, being a cook, but Hake was also lost",0
"So it was left to the surviving stewards to do what they could for the wounded, which was little enough",0
"At least they are dry here, with a re to warm them",0
"They need more food, though",0
"He was sober now, though",0
"Well, he¡¦d had two horns of ale when he broke his fast, and a small cup of red when he set out, but that was just to keep his head from pounding",0
"Merrett could feel the headache building behind his eyes, and he knew that if he gave it half a chance he would soon feel as if he had a thunderstorm raging between his ears. Sometimes his headaches got so bad that it even hurt too much to weep",0
"Then all he could do was rest on his bed in a dark room with a damp cloth over his eyes, and curse his luck and the nameless outlaw who had done this to him",0
Just thinking about it made him anxious. He could no wise aord a headache now,0
"If I bring Petyr back home safely, all my luck will change",0
"He had the gold, all he needed to do was climb to the top of Oldstones, meet the bloody outlaws in the ruined castle, and make the exchange",0
A simple ransom,0
"Even he could not muck it up ¡K unless he got a headache, one so bad that it left him unable to ride",0
"He was supposed to be at the ruins by sunset, not weeping in a huddle at the side of the road",0
Merrett rubbed two ngers against his temple,0
"Once more around the hill, and there I am",0
Merrett practically had to beg before they¡¦d give him the bloody bag of gold,0
"Merrett wasn¡¦t certain that was fortunate at all, and for that matter Lothar himself might be more dangerous than either of them",0
"Lord Walder had ordered the slaughter of the Starks at Roslin¡¦s wedding, but it had been Lame Lothar who had plotted it out with Roose Bolton, all the way down to which songs would be played",0
"Lothar was a very amusing fellow to get drunk with, but Merrett would never be so foolish as to turn his back on him",0
"In the Twins, you learned early that only full blood siblings could be trusted, and them not very far. It was like to be every son for himself when the old man died, and every daughter as well",0
"The new Lord of the Crossing would doubtless keep on some of his uncles, nephews, and cousins at the Twins, the ones he happened to like or trust, or more likely the ones he thought would prove useful to him",0
The rest of us he¡¦ll shove out to fend for ourselves. But only if he was there by sunset with the gold,0
Merrett glanced at the sky,0
Right on time,0
"He needed something to steady his hands. He pulled up the waterskin hung from his saddle, uncorked it, and took a long swallow",0
"The wine was thick and sweet, so dark it was almost black, but gods it tasted good",0
The curtain wall of Oldstones had once encircled the brow of the hill like the crown on a king¡¦s head,0
"Only the foundation remained, and a few waist-high piles of crumbling stone spotted with lichen",0
Merrett rode along the line of the wall until he came to the place where the gatehouse would have stood,0
"The ruins were more extensive here, and he had to dismount to lead his palfrey through them",0
"In the west, the sun had vanished behind a bank of low clouds. Gorse and bracken covered the slopes, and once inside the vanished walls the weeds were chest high",0
"Merrett loosened his sword in its scabbard and looked about warily, but saw no outlaws. Could I have come on the wrong day",0
"He stopped and rubbed his temples with his thumbs, but that did nothing to ease the pressure behind his eyes. It was the third evening since they had fled from the Company, as far as they could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the Emyn Muil, sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward, sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had been hours before",0
"Yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward, keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills. But always they found its outward faces sheer, high and impassable, frowning over the plain below; beyond its tumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even a bird was to be seen",0
"The hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff, bare and bleak, its feet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with drifting cloud",0
A chill wind blew from the East,0
Night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them; the sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown,0
"Far away to the right the Anduin, that had gleamed fitfully in sun-breaks during the day, was now hidden in shadow",0
"But their eyes did not look beyond the River, back to Gondor, to their friends, to the lands of Men",0
"South and east they stared to where, at the edge of the oncoming night, a dark line hung, like distant mountains of motionless smoke",0
Every now and again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky,0
